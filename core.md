title: "The CISC Core"
---

The diagram below shows the first four semesters of the Computer Science BS degree.
It's pretty much the same for all the concentrations and degrees (although the BA and Information Systems degrees have a few small differences in non-CISC courses).
That means you have some time to figure out how you want to specialize your degree.

Your primary goal is to complete CISC220 as soon as possible, since that is the prereq for almost all other CISC courses. After that, you actually have some flexibility.

# What is Computer Science?

In the following sections, I try to explain very briefly what Computer Science is, connecting the core topics back to the courses you take above.

## Problem Solving

Generally, Computer Science is all about problem solving.
Technically, so is every other Engineering field, but we do it with computers.
This often means writing programs, but a lot of the ideas go way beyond that.
In your first semester, the major point of CISC108 is to teach you problem solving.
What is a problem? How do we know if we solved it? How can we approach problems rigorously? How do we reuse solutions for similar problems? How do we tackle problems at scale? These are all questions that get introduced your first semester but are carried throughout your career.

## Programming

Programming is how we speak to computers and give them instructions. A lot of time early in your degree is all about writing simple programs that take input and produce output. We use programming languages like Python, Java, and C++ to write instructions. Precision is absolutely key to writing programs - you need to be specific and formal.

CISC108, CISC181, and CISC210 spend a lot of time just writing programs. Over time, these programs get bigger and bigger. You go from tens of lines to hundreds of lines. By the time you get to CISC220 and CISC275, you might be writing thousands of lines of code.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

Although CISC108 and CISC181 both introduce ideas related to Data Structures and Algorithms, the ideas become more critical in CISC220. In fact, these two topics are fundamental to Computer Science.

Data is how we represent the world in our computers. We can *abstract* real-world stuff, removing unnecessary details, in order to create information that can be encoded into a machine. Anything can be encoded this way: people, songs, stories, prices, books, etc. A critical concern for Computer Scientists is what structure and format we should use to encode data, since that strongly affects our ability to manipulate the information quickly and easily.

Algorithms are series of instructions that modify data. Programs are an example of algorithms that are able to be executed by a computer. However, humans can describe algorithms to each other without needing as much precision. Algorithms also have properties (such as readability, correctness, or efficiency) that make some more desirable than others.

Computer Scientists also think about the theories underlying problem-solving.
You may not know this, but we have learned fundamental truths about the universe through Computer Science.
For instance, in the early decades of Computer Science, researchers proved the smallest set of programming operations required to have a fully complete language that can solve any computable problem.
While doing so, they also proved that some problems are incomputable - no matter how strong a computer you have, these problems cannot be solved.
Some of the problems that fall into this category may be surprising: for instance, it is impossible to write a program that determines if ANY other program halts (The ["Halting Problem"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t37GQgUPa6k).
Although most of the early curriculum does not cover these ideas, their groundwork does appear in courses like MATH210, MATH205, and CISC220.

## Software Development 

Software Development is at the heart of every Computer Science degree. By using what we know about programming and the theories surrounding it, we can write large-scale programs that solve problems that real folks have. However, this is more than just coding or choosing data structures. Modern software development involves a huge amount of conversations with stakeholders to determine clients' actual needs, in order to build very complex inter-woven systems. CISC275 is the major course to unify all these ideas previously introduced.

## Machine Organization

Computer Science, unlike Computer Engineering, focuses largely on software rather than hardware (physical computing devices that run software). However, it's not realistic to talk about software without understanding at least the basics of how it interacts with hardware.
For that reason, two courses introduce basic ideas of how software and hardware coexist: CISC210 and CISC260.

## Ethics of Computing

Computer Science gives us new knowledge and power, which can let us change the world.
These changes have not always been for the better, and we always run the risk of making things worse.
For that reason, UD Computer Science has an emphasis on ethical reasoning to help you navigate the ethics of software development.
Although all courses integrate ethics at different times, an entire course is also dedicated to the topic: CISC355.

# Subfields of Computer Science

Computer Science is a truly massive field. The core prepares you for a wide array of experiences, and then you can specialize further with a concentration. The videos below give you a quick run through of many of the possible concentrations, subfields, and careers available to you. But remember these are not exhaustive, there's so much more out there!

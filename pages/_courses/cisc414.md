Formal approaches to the specification, verification, and design of software systems. Topics include representing programs as transition systems; liveness and safety properties; state space reachability; explicit, symbolic and automata-based model checking; temporal logics; symbolic execution; automated theorem-proving; and relational calculus. Learn to use state-of-the-art tools based on these methods, such as the model checker Spin.

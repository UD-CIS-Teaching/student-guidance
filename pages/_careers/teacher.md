Teaching is one of the most rewarding jobs in the world, and also one of the worst. It's a great way to make a difference, but often discredited despite its critical nature. Teaching salaries, whether in K-12 or higher education, are not as high as other CS career paths. Still, we need teachers, and this is a viable career path. Although a Computer Science degree prepares you to teach K-12, most states require further accreditation before you can get into a classroom. At the university level, most schools expect at least a Masters or several years of industry experience before you can teach introductory courses; for levels beyond, you should plan to obtain a PhD in Computer Science or a related field.

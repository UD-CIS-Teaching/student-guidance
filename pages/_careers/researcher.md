Research varies tremendously between different subfields of Computer Science, but generally requires critical thinking, passion, and discipline. The best researchers have problems that they wish to actively seek out and solve, and are driven by a need to understand (and often change) the world. Often, researchers take academic positions and also teach, although some work for companies too. They leverage skills in high performance computing, data science, software engineering, and more.

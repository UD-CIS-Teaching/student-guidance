Educational Technology is a somewhat narrow field that stands at the intersection of many others - Software Engineering, Usability Engineering, Human-Computer Interaction, and Education. Modern educational software development requires a tremendous amount of knowledge of industry standards and laws that govern educational data and access. Furthermore, actually developing software to help people learn is challenging, but rewarding.

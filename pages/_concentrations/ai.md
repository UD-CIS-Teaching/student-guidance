Computers are dumb. They follow instructions fast, but cannot think for themselves. Artificial Intelligence is all about ways to make computers appear to be smarter.

## Official Description

The B.S. in Computer Science with Concentration in Artificial Intelligence & Robotics provides a broad background in core computer science topics, supplemented by advanced courses in logic, machine learning, computer vision, and a number of electives in related areas of linguistics, electrical and mechanical engineering, and psychology. The Department of Computer & Information Sciences has substantial expertise in AI and robotics, with many faculty specializing in AI research, including natural language processing, multi-agent systems, knowledge representation, computer vision, intelligent tutoring systems, and robotic development.

Artificial Intelligence has become important in many areas in recent years, with applications spanning a broad range of fields and topics. In aviation, finance, healthcare, telecommunications and transportation, for example, AI has become critical to keeping up with today's challenges. A [recent article in Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2017/12/21/13-top-techskills-in-high-demand-for-2018) lists "experience with AI" as the number one in-demand tech skill for 2018. Another [article from Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2018/01/12/10-chartsthat-will-change-your-perspective-on-artificial-intelligences-growth) states that the share of jobs requiring AI skills has grown by 4.5x since 2013 and further shows the vast growth in the AI sector in recent years. This article further singles out machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing as the three most in-demand skills. These are all areas for which the CISC Department has specific expertise.

Graduates of this program will have the background and knowledge to pursue careers in artificial intelligence to solve problems within these - and many other - fields. The program will serve students who are interested in the theoretical underpinnings of artificial intelligence and robotics, as well as in advanced applications in machine learning, robotics, natural language processing, and computer vision. Students from this program will be well-prepared for graduate study in AI/robotics areas of computer science, as well as a career in artificial intelligence.

description: Data is everywhere.  Large and diverse datasets representing every aspect of modern life are now available.  These data come in a variety of forms that can be either structured or unstructured.  Data science is concerned with translating these disparate data sources into useful knowledge, through application of techniques drawn from computer science, mathematics, and statistics.  The data science concentration provides the core background necessary for representing, analyzing, managing and putting these datasets to use in real-world applications.  This concentration combines courses in advanced mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data mining, preparing students to make contributions in this highly interdisciplinary field.

The B.S. in Computer Science with Concentration in Data Science
provides a broad background in core computer science topics,
supplemented by advanced courses in mathematics, statistics,
artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML).

Given the explosive growth of technology and the vast amounts of data
currently available, there is a strong need for data scientists in
many fields.  A [2017 joint report](http://www.bhef.com/sites/default/files/bhef_2017_investing_in_dsa.pdf) by PwC and the Business-Higher Education forum states that 69% of employers say they will prefer job candidates with
Data Science skills.  This report also suggests that new job postings
requiring data science and data analytics skills will reach 2.72
million by the year 2020.  This proposed concentration within the
Computer Science BS program will seek to prepare students interested
in this career path.

This concentration has been developed with input from Data Science
faculty, and meets all requirements to be used in conjunction with the
proposed 4+1 program in Data Science as well as all prerequisites to
apply for a separate Master of Science degree in Data Science.

Students in the honors program will be able to choose this
concentration for an honors degree.  Students will be able to take the
graduate (600+ level) version of many courses (including CISC 637,
CISC 683, and CISC 684) for honors credit while also fulfilling the
concentration requirements.  Students will also be able to substitute
the 600+ level version of courses used for the CISC Elective for
honors credit.

The program will serve students who are interested in data science as
well as the AI and ML techniques which go along with it.  Students
from this program will be well-prepared for graduate studies in
computer science or data science, as well as working in the growing
field of Data Science.

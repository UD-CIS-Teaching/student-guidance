description: Getting data in and out of large databases efficiently is often the single biggest bottleneck of any program. Information Retrieval aims to solve this problem with an array of techniques and methods that focus on a wide variety of situation involving data. How to structure the database design efficiently, how to build queries that move fast, and how to organize the data itself are all directions that IR goes in. Often particularly focused on document storage and lookup, Information Retrieval is a critical subfield in the modern Big Data era.

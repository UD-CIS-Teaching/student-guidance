# Concentrations FAQ

## "What is the best concentration?"

There is no best concentration. You find one that interests you, or you match one to your classes. Everyone finds their own path in CS.

## "Do concentrations matter?"

A little. They help you tell the story of your degree more easily. When you say, "I have a concentration in Cybsecurity", people will expect you to have a certain set of experiences and to be familiar with certain tools, as opposed to if you had a concentration in HCI or AI. Can you change your focus later? Absolutely! But it helps package what you have done into something easily understandable.

## "How do I pick a concentration?"

You can read over the descriptions about what sounds interesting, and make some guesses. But ultimately you don't *know* until you try it. As soon as you finish CISC220, start signing up for advanced CISC courses and see what you enjoy.

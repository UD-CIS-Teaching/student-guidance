One of the best ways to get ahead in computing is to have side-projects.
The goal is to spend a lot of time working on real problems.
The trick is that, given how busy you are, you will need to be self-motivated.
Having a cool side-project can provide the energy you need to make progress on your own.
If successful, you have something to show off to employers, professors, friends, and the world.
If unsuccessful, you walk away with a tremendous amount of experience that will serve you very well.

There are three general hard parts in side-projects:

1. Choosing a project
2. Getting started
3. Making progress

Most of this document is a list of project ideas.
However, you should think critically about how to get started and how to keep making progress.
It's very easy to *want* to make something cool - it's *hard* to make something cool.
Here's four tips for keeping your momentum:

* Journey, not destination: You might never finish your project. That's cool, no one is grading it. Focus on what you learn along the way. 
* Socialize with it: Talk to your friends, colleagues, and professors. Positive feedback and interest feels good and will keep you going.
* Make time: You will have a lot of options in college, and side-projects shouldn't fill all of your time. But arrange time specifically to work on it or you never will.
* Have milestones: Don't set out to do everything, break down the project into chunks that are doable. You want to be able to see progress.

# Going Beyond

After a certain point, you should consider finding either internships or undergraduate research projects.
If you're good at something like Computer Science, it's smart to find ways to get paid for it.

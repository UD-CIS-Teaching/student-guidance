description: Natural Language Processing aims to make software that can read, understand, and derive meaning from human languages. Although it might be considered a subfield of Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning, NLP has many of its own specialized methods and applications. Some well-known but still open problems include translating between human languages, checking grammar and spelling, responding to human voice commands, or building accessible tools for folks with disabilities.

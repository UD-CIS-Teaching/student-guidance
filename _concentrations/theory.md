description: "The Theory and Computation concentration bridges the mathematics-computer science interface.  Applications flow in both directions: mathematical concepts, such as formal logic, automata, and models of computation, form the theoretical foundation of computer science, while computational methods are widely used in many areas of mathematics, including linear algebra, graph theory, differential equations, algebra, theorem proving, and algorithmic analysis.  The concentration offers a broad spectrum of courses in these and other subjects in mathematics and computer science.  Students in the concentration have a choice between a \"discrete\" and a \"continuous\" track."

The B.S. in Computer Science with Concentration in Theory and
Computation provides a broad background in core computer science
topics, supplemented by advanced courses in logic, mathematics, and
the theory of computation.

The program will serve students who are interested in the theoretical
underpinnings of computer science as well as advanced applications in
mathematics, such as numerical methods and graph algorithms. Students
from this program will be exceptionally well-prepared for graduate
study in any area of computer science or computational science, or for
working in any field requiring a deep mathematical understanding of
algorithms.

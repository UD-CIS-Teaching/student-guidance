description: Bioinformatics lies at the intersection of computational science and biology.  The field is gaining impact in recent years as biology becomes increasingly data-centric and quantitative.  There is a growing need for individuals with training in biology, chemistry, and computer science. This concentration combines background in life sciences with expertise in computational methods to fill this need. Students successfully completing this concentration will be well-prepared for graduate studies in computer science or bioinformatics and for a variety of interdisciplinary careers in industry and in health and research institutes.

The B.S. in Computer Science with Concentration in
  Bioinformatics provides a broad background in core computer science
topics, supplemented by courses in chemistry, biology, mathematics,
and machine learning related to the field of bioinformatics.

Bioinformatics is an emerging field at the intersection of
computational science and biology.  The field has grown in recent
years, as biology becomes increasingly data-centric and quantitative.
According to the University of Delaware's Center for Bioinformatics
and Computational Biology, "[t]he bioinformatics market is expected
to grow to $12.86B by 2020"
([https://bioinformatics.udel.edu/](https://bioinformatics.udel.edu/)).  There is a growing need for
individuals with training in biology, chemistry, and computer
science. This program will combine science with computational methods
to fill this need.

The University of Delaware has an active bioinformatics community.
The Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology promotes and
coordinates interdisciplinary activities, offering both an M.S. and a
Ph.D. program in Bioinformatics.  The director and several members of
this center are faculty in the Department of Computer and Information
Sciences.

This proposed undergraduate program will cater to students who are
interested in the application of computational methods to the field of
biology.  Students from this program will be well-prepared for
graduate study in computer science or bioinformatics, as well as a
career in bioinformatics.

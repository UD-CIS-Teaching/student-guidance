description: Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that incorporates computer science and biology to research, develop, and apply computational tools and approaches to manage and process large sets of biological data. The Bioinformatics career focuses on creating software tools to store, manage, interpret, and analyze data at the genome, proteome, transcriptome, and metabalome levels. Primary investigations consist of integrating information from DNA and protein sequences and protein structure and function. Bioinformatics jobs exist in biomedical, molecular medicine, energy development, biotechnology, environmental restoration, homeland security, forensic investigations, agricultural, and animal science fields. Most bioinformatics jobs require a Bachelor's degree. Post-grad programs, University level teaching & research, and administrative positions require a graduate degree.

The B.S. in Computer Science with Concentration in
  Bioinformatics provides a broad background in core computer science
topics, supplemented by courses in chemistry, biology, mathematics,
and machine learning related to the field of bioinformatics.

Bioinformatics is an emerging field at the intersection of
computational science and biology.  The field has grown in recent
years, as biology becomes increasingly data-centric and quantitative.
According to the University of Delaware's Center for Bioinformatics
and Computational Biology, "[t]he bioinformatics market is expected
to grow to $12.86B by 2020"
([https://bioinformatics.udel.edu/](https://bioinformatics.udel.edu/)).  There is a growing need for
individuals with training in biology, chemistry, and computer
science. This program will combine science with computational methods
to fill this need.

The University of Delaware has an active bioinformatics community.
The Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology promotes and
coordinates interdisciplinary activities, offering both an M.S. and a
Ph.D. program in Bioinformatics.  The director and several members of
this center are faculty in the Department of Computer and Information
Sciences.

This proposed undergraduate program will cater to students who are
interested in the application of computational methods to the field of
biology.  Students from this program will be well-prepared for
graduate study in computer science or bioinformatics, as well as a
career in bioinformatics.

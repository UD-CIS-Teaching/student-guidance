description: Backdoor vulnerabilities. Denial of service attacks. Viruses, worms, and cyberintrusions. Massive security breaches at major corporations, government facilities, and other institutions are announced on a regular basis. Is it any surprise that cybersecurity experts are among the most in-demand computer science professionals? Students in this concentration study the whole spectrum of vulnerabilities as well as countermeasures to defend against them. Learn how to design secure software/hardware systems and networks; explore intrusion detection, cryptographic protocols, firewalls, and access control, among other topics.

The B.S. in Computer Science with Concentration in Cybersecurity
provides a broad background in core computer science topics,
supplemented by advanced courses in systems and software security.

The University of Delaware has substantial expertise in Cybersecurity. [UD's Cybersecurity Inititiave](https://csi.udel.edu/) is a partnership with government and private companies to reduce vulnerabilities in the national information infrastructure.  UD currently offers a minor and a masters program in Cybersecurity as well as the [Cybersecurity Scholars Program](https://www.udel.edu/apply/undergraduate-admissions/enrichment-opportunities/cybersecurity-scholars/).

UD was named a National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Education by the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security.

Cybersecurity is an important and growing field with a high demand for
trained professionals with specific expertise.  A [2017 Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2017/03/16/the-fast-growing-job-with-a-huge-skills-gap-cyber-security/)
quotes an ISACA report that predicts a global shortage of
CyberSecurity professionals of two million by the year 2019.

The program will leverage the expertise at the University to serve
students who are interested in security issues for hardware, computer
networks, and software design.  Students from this program will be
well-prepared for graduate study in security areas of computer science
or for working in the high-demand field of Cybersecurity.

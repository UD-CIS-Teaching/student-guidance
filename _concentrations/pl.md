description: PL researchers work on making programming languages better, but PL research is broader than designing and implementing new languages. Programming language have a central place in solving computing problems. From this vantage point, PL researchers tend to focus on developing general abstractions, or building blocks, for solving problems, or classes of problems. PL research also considers software behavior in a rigorous and general way, e.g., to prove that (classes of) programs enjoy properties we want, and/or don't have properties we don't. This approach has proven to be very valuable for solving a wide ranging set of problems. PL has applications for many problem areas, including security, quantum computation, computing education, machine learning, and many others.

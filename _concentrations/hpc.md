description: High Performance Computing researchers and engineers are applying the world's most powerful computers to a wide array of scientific and engineering challenges, including climate modeling, weather prediction, the design of aircraft, skyscrapers, and automobiles, the development of new pharmaceuticals and medical treatments, modeling of the human brain, galactic interaction, and the nature of matter. The HPC concentration delves into all aspects of these advanced computing systems, from the hardware level to the programming languages, parallel algorithms, mathematical underpinnings, and applications.  The concentration also offers a choice between a data track which focuses on data analysis and statistics, and an applied mathematics track which focuses on the mathematical tools used to model real-world phenomena.

The BS in Computer Science with Concentration in High Performance
Computing provides a broad background in core computer science topics,
supplemented by advanced courses related to the field of High
Performance Computing (HPC).  

The advanced courses provide relevant systems background, including
courses on computer architecture, operating systems, compilers, and
networks.  They also include a number of mathematics courses,
including 3 semesters of Calculus, and a probability or statistics
course.  Parallel computing is also required by the concentration.

Students also choose between an applied mathematics or data science
track.  The applied mathematics track covers differential equations
and numeric methods; this track is appropriate for students interested
in using HPC to solve problems in computational science and
engineering.  The data science track includes a probability and an
advanced statistics course, as well as a database course, and a
machine learning or information retrieval course; this track is
appropriate for students interested in using HPC in the analysis of
"big data."

Graduates of this program will be well-placed to pursue a career in
one of the many fields that use HPC or for further study of HPC in
graduate school.  HPC is used by researchers in climate modeling; for
the discovery of new pharmaceuticals; in the engineering of aircraft,
automobiles, buildings, and other structures; for the design of
nuclear reactors; in the study of astronomical phenomena; for the
study of the electronic structure of matter; and in many other
engineering and scientific pursuits.

description: Software engineers are computer science professionals who use knowledge of engineering principles and programming languages to build software products, develop computer games, and run network control systems. Although in theory most of Computer Science trains you to be a Software Engineer, with a concentration you can focus more deeply on the advanced methods and systems that pervade the process of software development. Advanced techniques in testing, documentation, client communication, development operations, and more make this a deep, rich subject to study.

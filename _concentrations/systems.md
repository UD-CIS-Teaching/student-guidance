description: Are you interested in implementing a new programming language or a virtual machine for a new computer or network architecture?  Contributing to the next operating system or Internet of everything?  Improving the security of software and networks?  Then the Systems and Networks concentration is for you.  Through a range of courses covering operating systems, compilers, architecture, networks, and cybersecurity, students learn how modern computational systems function from the application layer all the way down to the hardware-software interface.

The B.S. in Computer Science with Concentration in Systems and
Networks provides a broad background in core computer science topics,
supplemented by advanced courses in compiler construction, parallel
programming, operating systems, computer architecture, computer
networks, and computer and network security.  This is one of the most
technically demanding and in-demand areas of computer science, dealing
with the complex "low-level" software and hardware systems which
provide the platform upon which higher-level programming languages and
applications are built.

Students in the honors program will be able to choose this
concentration for an honors degree.  These students will be able to
take the graduate (600+ level) version of many course for honors
credit while also fulfilling the concentration requirements.  Students
will also be able to substitute the 600+ level version of courses used
for the CISC Elective for honors credit.

The program will be appeal to students who are interested in system
design, implementation, and security as well as computer networks and
applications.  Students from this program will be well-prepared for
graduate study in the systems area of computer science or computer
engineering, or for working in research labs or industry implementing
operating systems, compilers, programming languages, or network
protocols and applications.

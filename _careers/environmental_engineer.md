Environmental Engineers main focus is analyzing DNA sequences to better understand/help the environment. This can be useful in energy production, environmental cleanup, industrial processing, and toxic waste reduction. Some specific areas they focus on are looking at DNA of species that depend on carbon to address climate change concerns, sequence DNA of plants and animals to produce stronger, resistant crops and healthier livestock, and transfer genes into plants to improve nutritional quality.

Computer network architects design, implement, and maintain networking and data communication systems, including local area networks, wide area networks, extranets, and intranets. They assess the needs of organizations for data sharing and communications. Computer network architects also evaluate the products and services available in the marketplace. Computer network architects test systems before they are implemented and resolve problems as they occur after the setup is in place. Computer network architects need to have the analytical skills to evaluate computer networks.

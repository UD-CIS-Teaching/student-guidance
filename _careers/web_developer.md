With an increasingly internet-connected world, web development is a critical skill for any Computer Scientist. Web developers assess the needs of users for information-based resources. They create the technical structure for websites and make sure that web pages are accessible and easily downloadable through a variety of browsers and interfaces. Web developers structure sites to maximize the number of page views and visitors through search engine optimization. They must have the communication skills and creativity needed to ensure the website meets its users' needs. Web Developers often self-classify themselves as Front-end, Back-end, or Full-stack, depending on what aspect they focus on.
